Biography
------
Hi! I am a CS Ph.D. student at the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw). I am part of the [Wagner Lab](https://wagner-group.github.io), [Security Group](https://security.cs.berkeley.edu), and [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu). I got my M.Eng. and B.Eng. ([Summa Cum Laude](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/summa-cum-laude.asp)) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) with Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin). I also had a great time visiting [UW](https://www.washington.edu), [NEU](https://www.northeastern.edu), [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu), and interning at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us), [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research). I was the chief director of three 1K-spectator concerts. 

My research focuses on **AI security** in real-world applications. I am interested in behavior control of large language models for trustworthiness, e.g., prompt injection defense ([StruQ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363), [Jatmo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)) and rule-following ([RuLES](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~normanmu/llm_rules)). See my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmHL5TfvXIGuNRIPX9DHT_LwRCu1Hkf1/view?usp=sharing) or (previous) [SoP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nmocMJFOmw_5_N1roe96Vszhhg7zhaZS/view?usp=sharing) for more of my work on trustworthy vision models. Feel free to drop me an email if you would like to chat on research and/or PhD application([1](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/64783ca50000000013030400), [2](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/64783f86000000001203c96f), [3](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/64784058000000001300078e)).
