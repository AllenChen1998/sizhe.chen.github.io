Biography
------
I'm a M.S. student at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. I received my B.S. degree in Department of Automation, SJTU in 2020. My research interests are adversarial machine learning, model security, and interpretability of DNN.
