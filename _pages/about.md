Biography
------
Hi! I am a CS Ph.D. student at the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw). I am part of the [Wagner Lab](https://wagner-group.github.io), [Security Group](https://security.cs.berkeley.edu), and [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu). I got my M.Eng. and B.Eng. ([Summa Cum Laude](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/summa-cum-laude.asp)) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin). I also had a great time visiting [UW](https://www.washington.edu), [NEU](https://www.northeastern.edu), [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu), and interning at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us), [Meta AI FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research). I was the chief director of three 1K-spectator concerts. See more experiences/publications on my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmHL5TfvXIGuNRIPX9DHT_LwRCu1Hkf1/view?usp=sharing). 

My research focuses on **AI security** in real-world applications. I am currently interested in behavior control of large language models for trustworthiness, e.g., prompt injection defense ([arXiv'24](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363), [arXiv'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)) and rule-following ([arXiv'23](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~normanmu/llm_rules)). I have also worked on poison ([ICLR'23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p7G8t5FVn2h), [ICLR'23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9MO7bjoAfIA)) & query ([TAI'23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070787)) & transfer ([TPAMI'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238430), [PR'22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321006671), [ICASSP'23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096892)) attacks and black-box ([NeurIPS'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7hhH95QKKDX), [TIST'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617895)) & white-box ([CVPR'22](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Li_Subspace_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2022_paper), [CVPRW'23](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/AML/html/He_Investigating_Catastrophic_Overfitting_in_Fast_Adversarial_Training_A_Self-Fitting_Perspective_CVPRW_2023_paper.html)) defenses on computer vision models. Feel free to drop me an email if you would like to chat on research and/or [PhD application](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/633879303) ([previous SoP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nmocMJFOmw_5_N1roe96Vszhhg7zhaZS/view?usp=sharing)).
