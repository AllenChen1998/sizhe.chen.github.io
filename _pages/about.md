Biography
------
I'm an M.S. student at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Automation, SJTU in 2020. My research interests are robustness and characteristics of DNNs. See my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/97m0l5bhrn87yo9/cv-sizhe-chen.pdf?dl=0).
