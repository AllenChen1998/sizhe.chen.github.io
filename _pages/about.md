Biography
------
Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student of [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu). Previously, I got my M.Eng. (2023) and B.Eng. (2020) degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin), [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io), [Yanzhi Wang](https://web.northeastern.edu/yanzhiwang), and [Kun Zhang](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html). My research goal is to build trustworthy machine learning that is highly applicable in real-world scenarios. I am currently interested in using training dynamics to interpret deep neural networks. Feel free to email me if you have any questions, or if you are interested in a research collaboration.
