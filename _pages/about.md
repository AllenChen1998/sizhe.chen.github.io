Biography
------
Hi! I am a final-year Master's student supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) (SJTU), where I also got my Bachelor's degree. I am also fortunate to work with Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html), [Yanzhi Wang](https://web.northeastern.edu/yanzhiwang), and [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io). My research goal is to build trustworthy machine learning that is highly applicable in real-world scenarios. I am particularly interested in adversaries because they could well quantify the model security, robustness, and reliability and interpret what DNNs actually learn.
