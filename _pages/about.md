Biography
------
I'm a third-year postgraduate student at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Automation, SJTU. My research interests are adversarial learning in applications, machine learning. See my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhOlC-7jzFW24zUUARxMNrgVwxxBXxy2/view?usp=sharing). I'm applying for Ph.D. positions.
