Biography
------
Hi! I am a CS Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw) in [Wagner Lab](https://wagner-group.github.io) and [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu). I have interned at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research) and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us) and worked closely with [Chuan Guo](https://sites.google.com/view/chuanguo), [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io), and [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin). I got my M.Eng. and B.Eng. (Summa Cum Laude) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn). 

My research focuses on AI security in real-world applications. I am working on defenses against prompt injections ([StruQ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363), [Jatmo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)), which arise as LLM-integrated applications generally craft LLM inputs by concatenating a trusted prompt from the developer with an untrusted data from the user. Security against prompt injections enables broader use of LLMs as an agent. See my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmHL5TfvXIGuNRIPX9DHT_LwRCu1Hkf1/view?usp=sharing) or (previous) [SoP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nmocMJFOmw_5_N1roe96Vszhhg7zhaZS/view?usp=sharing) for my work on safe vision models. 

Outside research, I love to lift weights, play badminton, attend concerts, eat hotpots, and write blogs, e.g., on [Ph.D. application](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/633879303). I was the chief director of three 1K-spectator concerts. Feel free to drop me an email to connect!
