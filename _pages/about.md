Biography
------
Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw). I am part of the [Wagner Lab](https://wagner-group.github.io), [Security Group](https://security.cs.berkeley.edu), and [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu), I got my M.Eng. and B.Eng. (Summa Cum Laude) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin). I also had a great time visiting [UW](https://www.washington.edu), [NEU](https://www.northeastern.edu), [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu), and interning at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us), [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research). 

My research focuses on AI security in real-world applications. I am currently interested in behavior control of Large Language Models for trustworthiness, e.g., prompt injection defense, rule-following. I have also worked on the poison attacks ([ICLR'23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p7G8t5FVn2h), [ICLR'23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9MO7bjoAfIA)), query attacks ([TAI'23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070787)), transfer attacks ([TPAMI'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238430), [PR'22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321006671), [ICASSP'23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096892)), black-box defenses ([NeurIPS'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7hhH95QKKDX), [TIST'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617895)), white-box defenses ([CVPR'22](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Li_Subspace_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2022_paper), [CVPRW'23](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/AML/html/He_Investigating_Catastrophic_Overfitting_in_Fast_Adversarial_Training_A_Self-Fitting_Perspective_CVPRW_2023_paper.html)) on computer vision models.
