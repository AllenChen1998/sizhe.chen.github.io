Biography
------
Hi! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw) in [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). I am working closely with [Chuan Guo](https://sites.google.com/view/chuanguo) at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research) as a visiting researcher, and with [Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com) at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google); the two collaborations are generously supported by two [BAIR Commons](https://bcommons.berkeley.edu/home) from them. I got my M.Eng. (National Scholarship) and B.Eng. (Summa Cum Laude) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn) advised by Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin) and also with Prof. [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io).

My research focuses on AI security in real-world applications. I am currently working on prompt injection defenses ([SecAlign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05451), [StruQ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363), [Jatmo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)). [Prompt injection attack](https://www.ibm.com/topics/prompt-injection) is listed as the [#1 threat](https://genai.owasp.org) to Large Language Model (LLM) Integrated Applications, where a trusted prompt is concatenated to an untrusted data (user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc) as the LLM input. If the user data contains malicious instructions (Ignore previous instructions and ...), the LLM could be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. To open up new opportunities for safely using LLMs in systems (e.g., as agents), my goal is to design fundamental defenses to secure LLMs against prompt injections. My work on trustworthy vision models is listed in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmHL5TfvXIGuNRIPX9DHT_LwRCu1Hkf1/view?usp=sharing) and (previous) [SoP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nmocMJFOmw_5_N1roe96Vszhhg7zhaZS/view?usp=sharing). Feel free to drop me an email to connect!

I am fortunate to have mentored lots of talented students (and some from underrepresentative groups): [Jing Qian](https://jing-qian-98.github.io), [Shutong Wu](https://cychomatica.github.io), [Yingwen Wu](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yingwen_Wu1), [Zhixing Ye](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089933329), [Hend Alzahrani](https://sa.linkedin.com/in/hend-alzahrani), and [Zhengbao He](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Zhengbao_He1).

Selected Publications
------
+ Aligning LLMs to Be Robust Against Prompt Injection <br/> **Sizhe Chen**, Arman Zharmagambetov, Saeed Mahloujifar, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Chuan Guo <br/> [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05451) \| [Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HFnET2azKniaS4k5dvgVwoRLa4Eg584/view?usp=sharing) \| [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SecAlign) <br/> **SecAlign** formulates **prompt injection defense** as the preference optimization. From an SFT dataset, we build our preference dataset, where the "input" contains a benign instruction, a benign data, and an injected instruction; the "desirable output" responds to the benign instruction; and the "undesirable output" responds to the injected instruction. Then, we apply existing alignment techniques to fine-tune an SFT model on our preference dataset. Preserving utility, SecAlign secures Mistral-7B against strong optimization-based GCG with a 2% attack success rate, compared to 56% in the prior StruQ defense.
+ StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries <br/> **Sizhe Chen**, Julien Piet, Chawin Sitawarin, David Wagner <br/> [USENIX Security'25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363) \| [Talk](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/david-wagner-uc-berkeley-2024-10-14) \| [Code](https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/StruQ) <br/> **StruQ** is a general approach to **defend against prompt injection** by separating the prompt and data into two channels. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. We augment the SFT dataset with examples that additionally include instructions in data besides in prompt, and do SFT on the model to ignore instructions in data. Preserving utility, StruQ discourages all existing (optimization-free) prompt injections to an attack success rate of <2%.
+ One-Pixel Shortcut: On the Learning Preference of Deep Neural Networks <br/> Shutong Wu\*, **Sizhe Chen\***, Cihang Xie, Xiaolin Huang <br/> [ICLR'23 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p7G8t5FVn2h) \| [Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5SSuoGPcQCMul9N7pmp_1ON_xupKeoD/view?usp=sharing) \| [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1maneRbPHAbKd8-toYXnAcpqabNhciOEK/view?usp=sharing) \| [Code](https://github.com/cychomatica/One-Pixel-Shotcut) <br/> **OPS** perturbs only one pixel in each image to **poison model training** from the view of shortcut learning. OPS uses a heuristic model-agnostic search to find the pixel: perturbing in-class images at the same position to the same target value that could mostly and stably alter the original images. OPS degrades the model accuracy on clean data to almost an untrained counterpart. The perturbations, for the first time, are crafted within seconds (CIFAR-10) or minutes (ImageNet) and cannot be erased by adversarial training.
+ Adversarial Attack on Attackers: Post-Process to Mitigate Black-Box Score-Based Attacks <br/> **Sizhe Chen**, Zhehao Huang, Qinghua Tao, Yingwen Wu, Cihang Xie, Xiaolin Huang <br/> [NeurIPS'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7hhH95QKKDX) \| [Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DaVrjP0uTaolardNIYQDNO9z9NsH7ziM/view?usp=sharing) \| [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oexH2EjV0k9tBNOHkesHD9lIJlQKoE1o/view?usp=sharing) \| [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7tsEvbT10R750eldANDAlLRxqwT2pgg/view?usp=sharing) \| [Code](https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/AAA) <br/> **AAA** proposes a new direction to especially **defend against score-based query attacks** by maintaining predictions while disrupting gradients. We note that the efficient and realistic score-based attacks could be easily misled if the model logits are perturbed to create a periodically reverse loss trend. AAA secures WideResNet-28 with 80.59% accuracy under attack, compared to 67.44% from the best prior adversarial training defense. AAA does not hurt the accuracy, calibration, or inference speed, and can be directly plugged into any trained classifiers.
+ Universal Adversarial Attack on Attention and the Resulting Dataset DAmageNet <br/> **Sizhe Chen**, Zhengbao He, Chengjin Sun, Jie Yang, Xiaolin Huang <br/> [TPAMI'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238430) \| [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06325) \| [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KkcXy5No_hQ7wiqN5aawTpoBkms2jAy3/view?usp=sharing) \| [Code](https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/DAmageNet) <br/> **AoA** follows the proposed principle that **transfer attacks** should seek for features that are shared across different architectures, which tend to reveal their common vulnerabilities. We note that the attention heatmap (from the model interpretation tool) could be a shared feature, and constrain the attention as our attack loss, which improves the attack transferability by 30%. We apply AoA to generate 50K adversarial samples from the ImageNet validation set to get the **DAmageNet**, leading to >85% error rate on 13 undefended models and >70% error rate on most defended models.
+ Subspace Adversarial Training <br/> Tao Li, Yingwen Wu, **Sizhe Chen**, Kun Fang, Xiaolin Huang <br/> [CVPR'22 Oral](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Li_Subspace_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2022_paper) \| [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NaF_bZkrPvfsScLfVcjPqcPVQ3CW8hoK/view?usp=sharing) \| [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCwOfILYPF6SOudDrHp4t9Q1lu-BfPFf/view?usp=sharing) \| [Code](https://github.com/nblt/Sub-AT) <br/> **Sub-AT** approaches catastrophic overfitting and robust overfitting in **adversarial training** (AT) by constraining AT in a carefully extracted subspace. Sub-AT saves checkpoints during the regular training and performs SVD on the parameter matrix (each vector is a squeezed checkpoint) to get mutually orthogonal bases of the subspace. Then Sub-AT projects gradients to those bases in the remaining training, i.e., only alters very few independent parameters like the following LoRA. 1-step Sub-AT achieves a competitive performance v.s. standard 10-step AT, with even 40% less computation than standard 1-step AT.
